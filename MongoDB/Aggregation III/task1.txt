Fill in the code to find the name of the first document for each type group of pokemon, sort them by their type and output them in a field called "nameOfFirst".

db.pokemon.aggregate([
  {
    ???: {
      _id: "???",
      ???: {
  ???: "$name"  }
  }
 },
 { $sort: { _id: 1 } }
]);

> $group
> $type
> nameOfFirst
> $first
