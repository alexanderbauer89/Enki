Fill in the code to find the name of the last document for each type group of pokemon, sort them by their type and output them in a field called "nameOfLast".

db.pokemon.aggregat([
  {
    ???: {
      _id: "???",
      ???: {
   ???: "$name" }
  }
 },
 { $sort: { _id: 1 } }
]);

> $group
> $type
> nameOfLast
> $first
