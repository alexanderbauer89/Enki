Let's say we have a collection named students with 2000 documents. Each student has a name, studentId and averageGrade field. 
Count all documents whose averageGrade is greater than 90 and sort them in descending order.

db.students.???([
  {
    ???: {  ???:
 { $gt: 90 }  }
  },
  {
    $sortByCount:
"$averageGrade"
  }
])

> aggregate
> $match
> averageGrade
> $sortByCount
