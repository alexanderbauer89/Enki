Consider the gender table. We want to add a new column called members. This column will store data about how many members each gender has using the INT type.

id  name
1   female
2   male
3   genderless

Complete the code to add the column:

???
  gender
ADD
  ??? ???;
  
string
ALTER TABLE
members
UPDATE
INT

> ALTER TABLE
> members
> INT
