Consider the generation table. We want to add a new constraint called PK-constraints in which we state that we want the region_id and name columns to be primary keys:

id    region_id   name
1     1           generation_i
2     2           generation_ii
3     3           generation_iii
4     4           generation_iv
5     5           generation_v
6     6           generation_vi

ALTER TABLE
  ???
ADD
  ??? PK-constraints
  ??? (region_id, name)
  
COLUMN
generation
name
gender, gender
KEY
CONSTRAINT
PRIMARY KEY

> generation
> CONSTRAINT
> PRIMARY KEY
