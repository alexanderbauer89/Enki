Consider the following table item.

id  cost  name
1   0     master-ball
2   1200  ultra-ball
3   600   great-ball
4   200   poke-ball

This table has a field called cost, indicating how much each item costs. 
We would like to know an average cost for all items in the table. 
Fill the gaps accordingly:

SELECT ???(???)
??? item

AVG SUM AS FROM
cost LIKE AVERAGE

> AVG
> cost
> FROM
