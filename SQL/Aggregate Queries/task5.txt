We know that the table pokedex_name has a field called name with 42 entries. 
We would like to see how many of these are distinct values. 
Which query do you think will have the desired output?

-- A
DISTINCT SELECT COUNT(name)
FROM pokedex_name;

-- B
SELECT *
FROM pokedex_name;

-- C
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(name)
FROM pokedex_name;

-- D
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name)
FROM pokedex_name;

A D B C

> D
