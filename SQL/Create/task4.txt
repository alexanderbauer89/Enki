Consider you have the following table called subsidiaries:

id    name    email
INT   VARCHAR VARCHAR

How would you define the employees table such that there is a constraint named emp_subs that defines a relationship between these two tables?

??? employees (
  id INT,
  first_name VARCHAR,
  last_name VARCHAR,
  subsidiary_id INT,
  email VARCHAR,
  ??? ???
  ??? (???)
  ??? subsidiaries(
  ???)
);

REFERENCES
MAKE TABLE
name
emp_subs
FOREIGN KEY
CONSTRAINT
RELATES
email
CREATE TABLE
PRIMARY KEY
(subsidiary_id)
id

> CREATE TABLE
> CONSTRAINT
> emp_subs
> FOREIGN KEY
> (subsidiary_id)
> REFERENCES
> id
