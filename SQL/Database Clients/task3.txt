If we consider psycopg2 library what's the correct order of connecting and then using it?

1 - ???
2 - ???
3 - ???
4 - ???

import psycopg2
establish a connection with the database
initialize a cursor
execute a query with the cursor

> import psycopg2
> establish a connection with the database
> initialize a cursor
> execute a query with the cursor
