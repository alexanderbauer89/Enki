Consider the following:

class Engine {
//not serializable
    private int
numberOfCilinders;
    private int volumeInLitres
;
    private String model;
    ...
}

class Car implements
Serializable {
    private String model;
    private Engine engine;
    private int topSpeed;
    ...
}

Is class Car serializable and if not why?

???

What could be done to Car in order to avoid the above problem?

???

Engine should be marked as public
No, Car doesn't implement the necessary interface
Car should implement clonable interface
No, Car doesn't inherit form a serializable class
Yes, Car is serializable
Engine should be marked as transient
No, Car has a non serializable field
