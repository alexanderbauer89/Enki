Why won't the following code snippet compile?

public class Person {
    private String name;
    public Person(String name){
      this.name = name;
    }
}
public class Company {
  Person p = new Person("Alex"
);
  System.out.println(p.name);
}

Field name of Person is private and cannot be accessed from Company.
this keyword is wrongly used.
p.name shouldn't be a String.
p is not instantiated correctly.

> Field name of Person is private and cannot be accessed from Company.
