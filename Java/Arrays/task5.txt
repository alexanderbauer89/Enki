Why are arrays more memory efficient?

How do you declare an ArrayList of type int?

???

Elements in array can only be accessed by index
They don't store any additional information such as next element pointer
You can't declare an ArrayList of primitive type like int
They are of a fixed length
ArrayList<int> arrList = new ArrayList<>();
