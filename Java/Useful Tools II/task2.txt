jstack works the same as pressing Ctrl-break in the console window where a Java program is running,
or by calling which two methods on each of the Thread objects in the VM?

Thread.getAllStackTraces() and Thread.dumpStack()
Thread.getStackTraces() and Thread.getDumpStack()
Thread.stackTraces() and Thread.allDumpStack()

> Thread.getAllStackTraces() and Thread.dumpStack()
