Suppose you want to load some data via an ajax call to your component after it was mounted.
Fill in the gaps such that you make sure you won't update the state with your ajax call login if the componen is unmounted:

class Component extends React.
Component {
  ???() {
    this.??? =
???;
    $.get(this.props.
ajaxSource, res => {
      if (???) {
        this.setState({
          propToUpdate: res
        })
      }
   })
}
render() {
    // ...
}
???() {
  this.mounted = false
  }
})

> componentDidMount
> mounted
> true
> this.mounted
> componentWillUnmount
