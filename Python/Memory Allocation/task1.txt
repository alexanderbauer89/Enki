Consider the following snippet. What do you think the memory location of c+1 is?

def mem_location(var):
  print(hex(id(var)))
  
c = 10
print(mem_location(c))
# 0x55a7b928f0a0

c = c + 1
print(mem_location(c))
# ???

> 0x55a7b928f0a0
> 0x55a7b928f0a0 + 0x1
> The address is not in this list.
> 0x55a7b928f0a0 + 0x11
