We have three lists, fnames, lnames, locations, which are ordered so that each index represents the same person, i.e. fnames[3], lnames[3] and locations[3]
all refer to the same person. We want to create 2-tuples of the first and last name of each person and have these inside 2-tuples which match first+last name tuples
with locations, such that the result looks like:

[(('italo', 'calvino'), 'IT'),
 (('jean', 'micheal'), 'FR'),
 (('emily', 'rambert'), 'FR'),
 (('katya', 'sokolov'), 'RU')]
 
 Fill in the gaps in the code below to achieve this. 
 
 location = ['IT',
             'FR',
             'FR',
             'RU']
fnames = ['italo',
           'jean',
           'emily',
           'katya']
lnames = ['calvino',
          'micheal',
          'rambert',
          'sokolov']
 
result = zip(???,
???)
result2 = zip(???,
???)
print(result2)

> fnames
> lnames
> result
> locations
