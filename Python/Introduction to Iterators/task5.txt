Let's say we have three lists. The first is a list of prices for items on an onine shop. The second is a list of proposed discounts, to be subtracted from those prices. 
Finally, the third list is a list of booleans which indicate which products (assume one product per index) are included in the sale.

Complete the code below to print a list of the original prices and a list of those same prices with the discount applied.

import itertools;

prices = [120, 300, 90, 200, 60]
discounts = [-30, -100, -35, -85, -15]
isInSale = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
salePrices = []

discountIterator =
itertools.compress(prices,
  isInSale)
  
def f(x):
  price = x + next(
discountIterator)
  salePrices.append(price)
  return(price <= 0)
  
print(
  list(
    itertools.???(
      lambda x: f(x),
fullPricesInSale)))

print(
  list(salePrices))
