Let's say we have a list, called promises. We want to make_good on all our promises, where make_good is a previously-defined function that takes a string.
Fill in the blanks in the code below to apply make_good to all elements in promises.

promises = ['learn css',
  'learn js',
    'buy milk',
  'be excellent to each other']
  
promises = ???(???, ???
)

promises
list
make_good
reduce
map
filter
lambda x: x*2

> map
> make_good
> promises
