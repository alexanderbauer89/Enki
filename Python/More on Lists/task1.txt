Using the Queue module we defined before. We want to print out the 2017 number. Fill the gaps accordingly:

import __

my_queue = Queue()

my_queue = enqueue(__)
my_queue = enqueue(__)
my_queue = enqueue(__)
my_queue = enqueue(__)

for n in __.items:
  print(n)
  
Queue, 2, 0, 1, 7, my_queue
Queue, 7, 1, 0, 2, my_queue
queue, 2, 0, 1, 7, my_queue
