Define the counter module that's supposed to increment its state with every function call.
Fill in the gaps such that the module will be successfully imported and ran.

# counter.py
count = 0

??? ???
  global count
  count += 1
  print(count)
  return count
  
# main.py
??? ???

counter.increment() # 1
counter.increment() # 2

> main.py
??? ???

counter.increment() # 1
counter.increment() # 2

> def
> increment():
> import
> counter
