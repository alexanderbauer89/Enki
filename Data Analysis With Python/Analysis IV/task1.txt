What does the .str.replace() method do in this code?

df['duration'] = \
  df['duration']\
  .str.replace(" min", "")
  
Replaces every string in the ??? column of the ??? DataFrame that has a ??? substring in it with ???.

df
a space
DF
replace
duration
nothing
" min"
"min "

> duration
> df
> " min"
> nothing
