Consider the response object proposed by the Express library.

How would you clear the cookie my-rogue-cookie?

res.???('???')

If an error happend we would like to send a "There is an error" message to the client.
Implement this, together with a 503 status code in the following snippet:

res???('???',
???)

> clearCookie
> my-rogue-cookie
> send
> There is an error
> 503
