Consider there is a Makefile in the output directory of your project. You want to run this with prod argument via an npm script called makeOutput:

How would you define the script?

{
  "name": "Enki",
  "???": {
    "???": "??? ???
???"
  }
}

How would you run the script?

??? ??? ???

&&
npm run
output
npm
scripts
makeOutput
and
prod
add
||
cd output
make
makeFile
makeOutput

> scripts
> makeOutput
> cd output
> &&
> make
> npm run
> makeOutput
> prod
