The async getBattery method of the Battery API returns a battery object.
Fill in the gaps in the following snippet such that you log each level change in the device's battery via an event listener:

navigator.???()
    .then((battery) => {
     ???.???(
        ???, () => {
         console.log(battery.
level * 100)
        }
      )
    })

> getBattery
> battery
> addEventListener
> 'levelChange'
