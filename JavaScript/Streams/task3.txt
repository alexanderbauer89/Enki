How would you pipe the data from a readStream of fileA.txt to a writeStream of fileB.txt,
both created through the fs module? Basically you have to move all the data from fileA to fileB.

let fs = require('fs')

let r = ???(???)
let w = ???.???(???)

???.???(???)

transfer
fs.createReadStream
writeStream
fs
fileB
fs.readStream
pipe
createWriteStream
fs.writeStream
'fileA.txt'
move
readStream
w
fileA
'fileB.txt'
r

> fs.createReadStream
> 'fileA.txt'
> fs
> createWriteStream
> 'fileB.txt'
> r
> pipe
> w
