Consider the function:

function compute (a, b, c, d) {
 return a + b * c + d;
}

If you have two arrays:

const arr1 = [2, 5]
const arr2 = [10, 30]

Complete the following function call such that the outputted value is correct:

console.log(
    compute(??? ???, ???)
)
// 82

...
...arr1
arr1
...arr2
arr2
,
[arr1]
[arr2]

> ...
> arr1
> ...arr2
