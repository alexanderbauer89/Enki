Consider the assignment:

const enki = 42;

What will the following do?

enki = 22;
// ???

But the following?

if (true) {
 const enki = 22;
 // ???
}

throw an error
assign 22 to enki within the if's scope
re-assign 22 to enki
also throw an error

> throw an error
> assign 22 to enki within the if's scope
