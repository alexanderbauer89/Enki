Using the following formula:

Retention rate = ( ( number of customers at the end - number of newly acquied customers) / number of customers at the start ) * 100

If we start with 500 customers and we acquire 100 new customers in a week, and we end the week with 500 customers, then our retention rate is:

80%
90%
20%
100%

> 80%
