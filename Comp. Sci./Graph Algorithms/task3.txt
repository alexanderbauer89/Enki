The main difference between Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's algorithm is that

Bellman-Ford is faster
Bellman-Ford works for graphs with negative-weighted edges
Dijkstra's outputs the distance between the source and every other node
Bellman-Ford is slower

> Bellman-Ford works for graphs with negative-weighted edges
