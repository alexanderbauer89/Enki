For small exponent values, squaring might need more operations than straight-forward approach.

5^5 would require 4 multiplicaitons, whereas, following the exponentatoin by squaring algorithm, the same computation would require a total of ??? operations 
(decompose+multiply)

3+2
3+1
3+3
2+3

> 2+3
