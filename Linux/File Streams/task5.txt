If you have a file with lines that look like this:

// clothing     expected
received    price
T-shirts    200     150
10.00
Jeans       300     299
29.99

Write an awk script that would calculate, for each line, the money left from the products not being received.
Assume that you are using the default whitespace separator:

awk '{??? ???'
 ~/shipment_track
500.00
29.99

> print
> ($2-$3)*$4
